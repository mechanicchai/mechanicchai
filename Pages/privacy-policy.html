                        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="body">
<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Website Operator ("Website Operator",
"we", "us" or "our") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information
("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide on the
mechanicchai.com website and any of its products or services (collectively, "Website" or
"Services").</p>
<p>It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal
Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not
apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that
we do not employ or manage.</p>
<h4>Automatic collection of information</h4>
<p>Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy.
We process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to
maintain the Website or Services. Information collected automatically is used only to
identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website
usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would
identify any particular user of the system.</p>
<h4>Collection of personal information</h4>
<p>You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by
which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you
wish to use some of the Website's features, you will be asked to provide certain
Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and
store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish
content, or fill any online forms on the Website. When required, this information may
include the following:
• Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
• Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not
be able to take advantage of some of the Website's features. Users who are uncertain
about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>

<h4>Managing personal information</h4>
<p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal
Information you can delete may change as the Website or Services change. When you
delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised
Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our
obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.</p>
<h4>Storing personal information</h4>
<p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply
with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer
retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data
derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but
not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires,
Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
the expiration of the retention period.</p>
<h4>Use and processing of collected information</h4>
<p>In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal
obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not
provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the
requested products or services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you
via our Website. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from
other sources. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following
purposes:
• Create and manage user accounts
• Send administrative information
• Respond to inquiries and offer support
• Request user feedback
• Improve user experience
• Administer prize draws and competitions
• Protect from abuse and malicious users
• Respond to legal requests and prevent harm
• Run and operate our Website and Services
Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our Website,
where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) You have given</p>

<p>your consent for one or more specific purposes. This, however, does not apply,
whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection
law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with
you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for
compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to
a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
<p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you
object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other
of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific
legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
<h4>The rights of users</h4>
<p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In
particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw
consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your
information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the
processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to
learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain
aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing;
(iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be
updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for
any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to
obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to
receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format
and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any
hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by
automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract
which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>
<h4>Privacy of children</h4>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of
13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information
through our Website or Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor</p>

<p>their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children
never to provide Personal Information through our Website or Service without their
permission.
If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal
Information to us through our Website or Service, please contact us. You must also be
old enough to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in
some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>

<h4>Newsletters</h4>
<p>We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We
are committed to keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your
email address to any third parties except as allowed in the information use and
processing section. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who
the e-mail is from and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. You may
choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the
unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However, you will
continue to receive essential transactional emails.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>The Website uses "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a
text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used
to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to
operate our Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. To learn more about cookies and how to
manage them, visit internetcookies.org</p>
<h4>Do Not Track signals</h4>
<p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit
that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as
using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes,
tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use</p>

<p>or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time.
How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this
Website is not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated
by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit
our use and collection of your personal information.</p>
<h4>Links to other websites</h4>
<p>Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us.
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
websites or third-parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website
and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that may collect Personal
Information.</p>
<h4>Information security</h4>
<p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure
environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain
reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect
against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information
in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless
network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal
Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the
Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and
all information and data exchanged between you and our Website cannot be
guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in
transit by a third-party, despite best efforts.</p>
<h4>Data breach</h4>
<p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been compromised
or users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result
of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the
right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation
and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement
authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify
affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a
result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a
notice on the Website, send you an email, get in touch with you over the phone, mail
you a letter.</p>

<h4>Legal disclosure</h4>
<p>We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by
law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe
in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the
safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
<h4>Changes and amendments</h4>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in our discretion and will notify you
of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When
changes are made, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may
also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact
information you have provided. Any updated version of this Privacy Policy will be
effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise
specified. Your continued use of the Website or Services after the effective date of the
revised Privacy Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your
consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your
Personal Data in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your
Personal Data was collected. Policy was created with WebsitePolicies.</p>
<h4>Acceptance of this policy</h4>
<p>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and
conditions. By using the Website or its Services you agree to be bound by this Policy. If
you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to use or
access the Website and its Services.</p>
